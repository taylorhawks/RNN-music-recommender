## Outline
#### MVP
- Get playlist and song data from spotify API
- Train and evaluate RNN
- PCA and visualization
- Functional input/output

#### Optional
- API with I/O
- Key considerations (see quantifying dissonance)
- Genre considerations
- Dimensionality reduction
- Try different distance metrics
  
 #### Very optional
 - 3D Animated Visualization
 - Combine with collaborative factors
